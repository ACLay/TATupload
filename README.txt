TATupload is designed to get relevant data from SMS messages sent to Text a Toastie events, and put it into a spreadsheet on Google Drive so you don't have to type it up yourself.

Please remember though that the data extracted may not be correct and texts should still be read carefully, to ensure the correct deliveries are made and that any reported food allergies are taken into account. That's still your responsibility, not mine.

This app is provided for free and is open source. The source code can be found at www.github.com/ACLay/TATupload

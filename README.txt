TATupload 2 is now available at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.sucu.tatupload2
It no longer uploads texts using the web browser, and has many other improvements as well. It does require up to date Google Play services, so this version will remain online for older phones that can't support them.

TATupload is an android app designed to get relevant data from SMS messages sent to Text a Toastie events, and put it into a spreadsheet on Google drive so you don't have to type it up yourself.

Data is uploaded using the phones web browser, and the google account signed into that browser.
It has been designed around the work flow of Text a Toastie (TAT) as done at the Southampton University Christian Union. I can't guarantee it will fit in at your TAT, but you're welcome to use it.

Before starting, be sure to enter the relevant locations you might be delivering to and flavours that you will be offering, to improve data extraction.

Permissions used:
Receive SMS messages - This allows the app to access texts sent to the phone. Processing texts in TATupload can be stopped when you're not running TAT.
View Network Connections - This lets the app tell if the phone is connected to the Internet, and if it's possible to upload a text.
Internet access is required to upload messages, but is done in the browser, so no permission is required by TATupload.

No guarantees are made that the data will be correctly extracted from texts, or that the data will always make it to the spreadsheet. Texts should be read carefully to ensure the correct toasties are delivered and that any reported food allergies are taken into account.
By using this app you agree not to hold the developer responsible for any incorrect deliveries made or allergic incidents that arise from these. 

I will be unable to fix problems on the servers for Google Drive or Google web scripts.

This app is provided for free and is open source. The source code can be found at www.github.com/ACLay/TATupload

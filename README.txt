TATupload
=========

An android app designed to get relevant data from SMS messages and put it into a spreadsheet on Google drive so you don't have to type it up yourself.

Data is uploaded using the phones web browser, and the google account signed into that browser.
It has been designed around the workflow of Text a Toastie (TAT) as done at the Southampton University Christian Union.
No guarantees are provided that it will fit your TAT, but you're welcome to use it.
If there's a feature you think the app could benefit from, or is missing, please contact the developer.

Permissions used:
Receive SMS messages - This allows the app to access texts sent to the phone. Processing texts in TATupload can be stopped when you're not running TAT.
View Network Connections - This lets the app tell if the phone is connected to the Internet, and if it's possible to upload a text.

No guarantees are made that the data will be correctly extracted from texts, or that the data will always make it to the spreadsheet. Texts should be read carefully to ensure the correct toasties are delivered and that any reported food allergies are taken into account.
By using this app you agree not to hold the developer responsible for any incorrect deliveries made or allergic incidents that arise from these. 

Before starting be sure to enter the relevant locations and flavours that you will be providing to improve data extraction.

I will be unable to fix problems on the servers for Google Drive or Google web scripts.

This app is provided for free and is open source. The code can be found at www.github.com/ACLay/TATupload

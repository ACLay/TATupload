This is a Google apps script that creates the form and spreadsheet, and enters the texts sent to it contained in the called URL.
A project that runs the code can be created at script.google.com

If you modify and use the script youself, the URL of the deployed script will need to be updated in the android apps strings.xml file.

The script is given in 3 files, but this just is for readability by grouping functions (entering texts, creating the form, receiving the call) and should be able to run from a single file with no issues.

When deploying, "Execute the app as:" should be set to "User accessing the web app". Otherwise users of the app who are not you, will be unable to access the submitted messages and created forms.

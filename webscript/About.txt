This is a Google apps script that creates the spreadsheet, and enters texts sent to it via the API.
A project that runs the code can be created at script.google.com

If you modify and use the script youself, the API ID of the deployed script will need to be updated in the android apps ApiAccessor class.

The script is given in 3 files, but this just is for readability by grouping functions (entering texts, creating the form, storing script settings) and should be able to run from a single file with no issues.

When deploying as an API executable, "Who has access to the script" should be set to "anyone". Otherwise users of the app who are not you will be unable to access the submitted messages and created forms.

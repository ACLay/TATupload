# Privacy Policy

TATupload 2 reads incoming text messages
and puts the information contained in them into a google spreadsheet.
To do so, it requires access to incoming texts and your google account.
Account authorization is provided by the Android operating system,
and no password details are stored by the app.
Text messages are only stored within the app on your phone
and in the spreadsheet which they are sent to.
At no point can the information be read by the developer of the app,
nor are they provided to any other party.

The first time the app tries to connect to a google spreadsheet,
it will ask for permissions to access your google drive spreadsheets,
as well as data associated with the application.
The data associated with the application allows it to identify the spreadsheet,
so that it can be accessed by the app even if it gets renamed or moved.
The app cannot proceed without these permissions.
If at a later date you wish to revoke TATupload's permissions to access your account,
you can do so by visiting https://myaccount.google.com/permissions
